## Installation

You can install the package via CRAN:

```         
install.packages("rqualify")
```

The package can also be installed from this Github repository using the following:

```         
# If needed install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("Medtronic-Biostatistics/rqualify")
```

## Purpose

The purpose of this package is to ease the R software validation steps required for regulatory submissions. The `rqualify` function automates the generation of a validation document that can be used to demonstrate that an R environment is suitable for use in a regulated setting.

## R Software Qualification

Once the `rqualify` package is installed, there are a few ways to execute the validation process. For instance, you can install Pandoc and TinyTeX as follows:

```         
library(rqualify)

# Install and activate Pandoc
pandoc_install()
pandoc_activate()

# Install the TinyTeX bundle plus the grfext package
install_tinytex(bundle="TinyTeX",
                force=TRUE,
                extra_packages="grfext")
              
rqualify(path_save     = tempdir(),
         setup_tinytex = FALSE,
         setup_pandoc  = FALSE)
```

Alternately, a more convenient approach to execute the entire validation process can be used, where the Pandoc and TinyTeX installation process are wrapped inside the function:

```         
library(rqualify)
rqualify(path_save = tempdir())
```

In any case, ensure that the `path_save` location does not already include a folder named `R-validation`. See `?rqualify` for more info.
